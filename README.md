Overbrewed is a potion selling game made using React and Javascript. In the Shopfront section, you will see cards on the top of the page that
show different randomized customers, with randomized potion requests. Underneath that, there is a section dedicated to the potions that you can sell at your shop
When you hit the cekc mark on a customer card, you are accepting their request and selling them a potion from your stock. You will make money and deplete your stock. 
To replenish stock, you can use the potion cards to brew more of each potion you carry. But it will csto moeny from your budget. 
You can use the Menu section to create additional potions. You can customize them with different images, description, name, and price. If you do not enter these things, 
default values will be added for you during the potion's creation. After interacting with 50 customers, the game ends with an alert that says "No More Customers!"
Your final score is the budget you have at that point.
